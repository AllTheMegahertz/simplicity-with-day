Simple Weather
===================

This watch face is inspired by Simplicity but with weather data added along the top. Weather information is downloaded from yahoo once every 30 minutes. It can either use your GPS location, or a specific location.

This face is only compatible with Pebble OS 2.0 which is currently in beta.

The configuration pages provides the following options:
- Enable/Disable GPS
- Set location for use if GPS is disabled
- Choose Celsius/Fahrenheit
- Invert colors (black text on a white background)
